# A high-level description of the solution
The application is also the implementation of the Reverse Polish notation algorimth
- It first used the node mudule "readline" to get the input from the users as the command line arguments
- If the input is invalid, it will prompt the users to reenter.
- After getting the input, it valiates and starts calculate the result and then shows it in the console
- During the caculating, it will show error message and clear the stack if the result is NaN.
- It keeps repeating the above steps until the users enter 'q or Q'

# Reasoning behind technical choices, including architectural
I picked Node.js because I feel most comfortable coiding in Javascript, and it's also very simple to compolie and test it.

# Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project
There's a lot of room to improve the project. If I got more time, I would work on the "isValid" function to make it more readable and cleaner. I would also develop something more user-friendly for the application.
 
# How to run the application:
1) STEP 1: Install node

2) STEP 2: Go to the file directory and run "node caculator.js"
